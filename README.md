# Growth characteristics of natural microbial populations are skewed towards bacteria with low specific growth rates  
Analyses associated with study exploring microbial population growth rates in response to dilution rate. Includes 16S rRNA gene sequencing &amp; trait-based modeling. This github repo is used for code development, see Joe Vallino's repo for final code associated with the published manuscript (https://github.com/maxEntropyProd)
